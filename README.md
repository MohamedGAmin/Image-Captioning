# Image-Captioning





## Setup and resources 

Having a GPU will speed up the image feature extraction process.

This repo will use the [Flickr8k image caption dataset](http://www.jair.org/papers/paper3994.html) for image caption generation. The dataset consists of 8000 images, each of which has five different descriptions of the salient entities and activities.
